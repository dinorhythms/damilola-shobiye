              <p className='mb-5'>
                On Tuesday 20 July 1982, the St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos,
                Nigeria, was filled with utmost joy and celebrations, as the
                family of Engineer Abayomi Omoyoyinsola Oyeledun and Late Mrs.
                Ojuloape Agbeke Oyeledun, welcomed the birth of their twin
                children named Oluwadamilola Oyetaiwo, and her twin brother
                Omowonuola Oyekehinde.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola grew up predominantly in the vibrant city of Ijebu
                Ode, Ogun State, with her parents and her four siblings.
                Oluwadamilola&apos;s siblings are Olaniyi her eldest brother,
                Teniola her sister, Omowonuola her twin brother, and Abiodun her
                youngest brother.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola also grew up with the abundance of her
                parents&apos; siblings, aunties, uncles, cousins, nephew,
                nieces, friends, and others.

              <p className='font-bold text-xl mb-5'>Marital Life and Family</p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola married her sweet lover, Peter Oladimeji Shobiye
                on 19 December 2008, at a celebration held at the Ikoyi Marriage
                Registry, Ikoyi, Lagos, with the attendance of parents, families
                and friends. Their traditional wedding thereafter took place on

                State, graced by parents, families, friends and acquaintances.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola and Peter&lsquo;s journey of love actually started
                in April 2005, they were fond of each other, and did almost
                everything together. Their love grew so vibrantly that it
                organically led to their decision to be married. Oluwadamilola
                and Peter loved travelling internationally, and they have both
                visited many cities across the globe, and every year both of
                them were always adding new cities to their travel bucket.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                In 2008, Peter moved to Glasgow, Scotland and after their
                wedding ceremonies in January 2009, Oluwadamilola joined him in
                Glasgow in February 2009, where they both studied and worked to
                start their own family.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                In July 2010, Oluwadamilola and Peter welcomed their first
                child, Iretemi, who was born at the Southern General Hospital,
                Glasgow, Scotland. Both the families of Shobiye and Oyeledun
                were filled with joy at the great news of the arrival of their
                great grandson, grandson, nephew, and cousin.{' '}
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                In December 2012, Peter and Oluwadamilola moved back to Lagos in
                order to concentrate and develop their law career in Nigeria,
                and to build a commercial law firm, which metamorphosised into
                the Law Firm known today as Pisteuo Solicitors with presence in
                Lagos, Abuja, and Kano.{' '}
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                In October 2015, Oluwadamilola and Peter welcomed their second
                child, Olamipo, who was born in Nevada, United States of
                America. Again, both the families of Shobiye and Oyeledun were
                filled with joy at the great news of the arrival of another
                great grandson, grandson, nephew, and cousin.{' '}
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola, Peter and the children lived together happily.
                They both trained their children in an atmosphere of love and
                peace. In August 2021, Oluwadamilola and Peter decided to expand
                their frontiers, with Oluwadamilola and their two children
                moving to Montreal, Canada, whilst Peter shuttled between
                Nigeria and Canada to manage their business and family
                interests.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-5'>
                Oluwadamilola and Peter were a loving couple and great parents
                to their children until the unfortunate demise of Oluwadamilola
                on 27 June 2024. All through her hospitalisation in Montreal
                Canada for 11+ months, Peter was always by Oluwadamilola&lsquo;s
                bed side daily, as he fought so hard for his wife, the love of
                his life, confidant and friend to stay alive and well.
